##  Usage

TicketBridge has **two main components**:

2. **UI Layer** ‚Äì Log in to manage tickets and generate API tokens.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sending Tickets via API

First, log in to the UI and generate an **API token**.  
Then, send a POST request to the API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://localhost:4000/api/tickets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": 1,
    "subject": "Test Ticket",
    "message": "This is a test ticket",
    "priority": "high",
    "category": "support"
  }'
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Managing Tickets via UI

- Log in to the web interface.
- View, update, and close tickets.
- Generate and revoke API tokens.
